Python Elasticsearch Client
===========================

Official low-level client for Elasticsearch. Its goal is to provide common
ground for all Elasticsearch-related code in Python; because of this it tries
to be opinion-free and very extendable.

For a more high level client library with more limited scope, have a look at
`elasticsearch-dsl`_ - a more pythonic library sitting on top of
``elasticsearch-py``.

It provides a more convenient and idiomatic way to write and manipulate
`queries`_. It stays close to the Elasticsearch JSON DSL, mirroring its
terminology and structure while exposing the whole range of the DSL from Python
either directly using defined classes or a queryset-like expressions.

It also provides an optional `persistence layer`_ for working with documents as
Python objects in an ORM-like fashion: defining mappings, retrieving and saving
documents, wrapping the document data in user-defined classes.

Compatibility
-------------

The library is compatible with all Elasticsearch versions since ``0.90.x`` but you
**have to use a matching major version**:

For **Elasticsearch 5.0** and later, use the major version 5 (``5.x.y``) of the
library.

For **Elasticsearch 2.0** and later, use the major version 2 (``2.x.y``) of the
library.

For **Elasticsearch 1.0** and later, use the major version 1 (``1.x.y``) of the
library.

For **Elasticsearch 0.90.x**, use a version from ``0.4.x`` releases of the
library.

The recommended way to set your requirements in your `setup.py` or
`requirements.txt` is::

    # Elasticsearch 5.x
    elasticsearch>=5.0.0,<6.0.0

    # Elasticsearch 2.x
    elasticsearch>=2.0.0,<3.0.0

    # Elasticsearch 1.x
    elasticsearch>=1.0.0,<2.0.0

    # Elasticsearch 0.90.x
    elasticsearch<1.0.0

The development is happening on ``master`` and ``2.x`` branches respectively.

Installation
------------

Install the ``elasticsearch`` package with `pip
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/elasticsearch>`_::

    pip install elasticsearch


Example use
-----------

Simple use-case::

    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

    # by default we connect to localhost:9200
    >>> es = Elasticsearch()

    # create an index in elasticsearch, ignore status code 400 (index already exists)
    >>> es.indices.create(index='my-index', ignore=400)
    {u'acknowledged': True}

    # datetimes will be serialized
    >>> es.index(index="my-index", doc_type="test-type", id=42, body={"any": "data", "timestamp": datetime.now()})
    {u'_id': u'42', u'_index': u'my-index', u'_type': u'test-type', u'_version': 1, u'ok': True}

    # but not deserialized
    >>> es.get(index="my-index", doc_type="test-type", id=42)['_source']
    {u'any': u'data', u'timestamp': u'2013-05-12T19:45:31.804229'}

Features
--------

The client's features include:

 * translating basic Python data types to and from json (datetimes are not
   decoded for performance reasons)
 * configurable automatic discovery of cluster nodes
 * persistent connections
 * load balancing (with pluggable selection strategy) across all available nodes
 * failed connection penalization (time based - failed connections won't be
   retried until a timeout is reached)
 * support for ssl and http authentication
 * thread safety
 * pluggable architecture
