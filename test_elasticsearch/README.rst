elasticsearch-py test suite
===========================

Warning - by default the tests will try and connect to `localhost:9200` and
will destroy all contents of given cluster! The tests also rely on a checkout
of `elasticsearch` repository existing on the same level as the
`elasticsearch-py` clone. Before running the tests we will, by default, pull
latest changes for that repo and perform `git reset --hard` to the exact
version that was used to build the server we are running against.

Running the tests
-----------------

To simply run the tests just execute the `run_tests.py` script or invoke
`python setup.py test`. The behavior is driven by environmental variables:

 * `TEST_ES_SERVER` - can contain "hostname[:port]" of running es cluster

 * `TEST_ES_CONNECTION` - name of the connection class to use from
    `elasticsearch5.connection` module. If you want to run completely with your
    own see section on customizing tests.

 * `TEST_ES_YAML_DIR` - path to the yaml test suite contained in the
    elasticsearch repo. Defaults to `$TEST_ES_REPO/rest-api-spec/test`

 * `TEST_ES_REPO` - path to the elasticsearch repo, by default it will look in
    the same directory as `elasticsearch-py` is in. It will not be used if
    `TEST_ES_YAML_DIR` is specified directly.
 
 * `TEST_ES_NOFETCH` - controls if we should fetch new updates to elasticsearch
   repo and reset it's version to the sha used to build the current es server.
   Defaults to `False` which means we will fetch the elasticsearch repo and
   `git reset --hard` the sha used to build the server.

Alternatively, if you wish to control what you are doing you have several additional options:

 * `run_tests.py` will pass any parameters specified to `nosetests`

 * you can just run your favorite runner in the `test_elasticsearch` directory
   (verified to work with nose and py.test) and bypass the fetch logic entirely.

Customizing the tests
---------------------

You can create a `local.py` file in the `test_elasticsearch` directory which
should contain a `get_client` function.

If this file exists the function will be used instead of
`elasticsearch5.helpers.test.get_test_client` to construct the client used for
any integration tests. You can use this to make sure your plugins and
extensions work with `elasticsearch-py`.
