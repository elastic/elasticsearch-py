== Getting started

This page guides you through the installation process of the Python client, 
shows you how to instantiate the client, and how to perform basic Elasticsearch 
operations with it.

[discrete]
=== Requirements

* https://www.python.org/[Python] 3.8 or newer
* https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/[`pip`], installed by default alongside Python

[discrete]
=== Installation 

To install the latest version of the client, run the following command:

[source,shell]
--------------------------
python -m pip install elasticsearch
--------------------------

Refer to the <<installation>> page to learn more.


[discrete]
=== Connecting

You can connect to the Elastic Cloud using an API key and the Elasticsearch 
endpoint. 

[source,py]
----
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

client = Elasticsearch(
    "https://...",  # Elasticsearch endpoint
    api_key="api_key",
)
----

Your Elasticsearch endpoint can be found on the **My deployment** page of your 
deployment:

You can generate an API key on the **Management** page under Security.

For other connection options, refer to the <<connecting>> section.


[discrete]
=== Operations

Time to use Elasticsearch! This section walks you through the basic, and most 
important, operations of Elasticsearch. For more operations and more advanced 
examples, refer to the <<examples>> page.


[discrete]
==== Creating an index

This is how you create the `my_index` index:

[source,py]
----
client.indices.create(index="my_index")
----

Optionally, you can first define the expected types of your features with a
custom mapping.

[source,py]
----
mappings = {
    "properties": {
        "foo": {"type": "text"},
        "bar": {
            "type": "text",
            "fields": {
                "keyword": {
                    "type": "keyword",
                    "ignore_above": 256,
                }
            },
        },
    }
}

client.indices.create(index="my_index", mappings=mappings)
----

[discrete]
==== Indexing documents

This indexes a document with the index API:

[source,py]
----
client.index(
    index="my_index",
    id="my_document_id",
    document={
        "foo": "foo",
        "bar": "bar",
    }
)
----

You can also index multiple documents at once with the bulk helper function:

[source,py]
----
from elasticsearch import helpers

def generate_docs():
    for i in range(10):
        yield {
            "_index": "my_index",
            "foo": f"foo {i}",
            "bar": "bar",
        }

helpers.bulk(client, generate_docs())
----

These helpers are the recommended way to perform bulk ingestion. While it is
also possible to perform bulk ingestion using `client.bulk` directly, the
helpers handle retries, ingesting chunk by chunk and more. See the
<<client-helpers>> page for more details.


[discrete]
==== Getting documents

You can get documents by using the following code:

[source,py]
----
client.get(index="my_index", id="my_document_id")
----


[discrete]
==== Searching documents

This is how you can create a single match query with the Python client: 

[source,py]
----
client.search(index="my_index", query={
    "match": {
        "foo": "foo"
    }
})
----


[discrete]
==== Updating documents

This is how you can update a document, for example to add a new field:

[source,py]
----
client.update(
    index="my_index",
    id="my_document_id",
    doc={
        "foo": "bar",
        "new_field": "new value",
    }
)
----


[discrete]
==== Deleting documents

[source,py]
----
client.delete(index="my_index", id="my_document_id")
----


[discrete]
==== Deleting an index

[source,py]
----
client.indices.delete(index="my_index")
----
