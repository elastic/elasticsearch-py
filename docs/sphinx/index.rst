Python Elasticsearch Client
===========================

Welcome to the API documentation of the official Python client for Elasticsearch!
The goal of this client is to provide common ground for all Elasticsearch-related
code in Python; because of this it tries to be opinion-free and very extendable.

High-level documentation for this client is `also available <https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/clients/python>`_.
