*The official Python client for Elasticsearch.*


Features
--------

* Translating basic Python data types to and from JSON
* Configurable automatic discovery of cluster nodes
* Persistent connections
* Load balancing (with pluggable selection strategy) across available nodes
* Failed connection penalization (time based - failed connections won't be
  retried until a timeout is reached)
* Support for TLS and HTTP authentication
* Thread safety across requests
* Pluggable architecture
* Helper functions for idiomatically using APIs together

Compatibility
-------------

Language clients are forward compatible; meaning that the clients support
communicating with greater or equal minor versions of Elasticsearch without
breaking. It does not mean that the clients automatically support new features
of newer Elasticsearch versions; it is only possible after a release of a new
client version. For example, a 8.12 client version won't automatically support
the new features of the 8.13 version of Elasticsearch, the 8.13 client version
is required for that. Elasticsearch language clients are only backwards
compatible with default distributions and without guarantees made.

+-----------------------+-------------------------+-----------+
| Elasticsearch version | elasticsearch-py branch | Supported |
+=======================+=========================+===========+
| main                  | main                    |           |
+-----------------------+-------------------------+-----------+
| 8.x                   | 8.x                     | 8.x       |
+-----------------------+-------------------------+-----------+
| 7.x                   | 7.x                     | 7.17      |
+-----------------------+-------------------------+-----------+

If you have a need to have multiple versions installed at the same time older
versions are also released as ``elasticsearch7`` and ``elasticsearch8``.

Feedback üó£Ô∏è
-----------

The engineering team here at Elastic is looking for developers to participate in
research and feedback sessions to learn more about how you use our Python client and
what improvements we can make to their design and your workflow. If you're interested in
sharing your insights into developer experience and language client design, please fill
out this `short form`_. Depending on the number of responses we get, we may either
contact you for a 1:1 conversation or a focus group with other developers who use the
same client. Thank you in advance - your feedback is crucial to improving the user
experience for all Elasticsearch developers!
