    Simple class used to select a connection from a list of currently live
    connection instances. In init time it is passed a dictionary containing all
    the connections' options which it can then use during the selection
    process. When the `select` method is called it is given a list of
    *currently* live connections to choose from.

    The options dictionary is the one that has been passed to
    :class:`~elasticsearch.Transport` as `hosts` param and the same that is
    used to construct the Connection object itself. When the Connection was
    created from information retrieved from the cluster via the sniffing
    process it will be the dictionary returned by the `host_info_callback`.

    Example of where this would be useful is a zone-aware selector that would
    only select connections from it's own zones and only fall back to other
    connections where there would be none in it's zones.

    Initially connections are stored on the class as a list and, along with the
    connection options, get passed to the `ConnectionSelector` instance for
    future reference.

    Upon each request the `Transport` will ask for a `Connection` via the
    `get_connection` method. If the connection fails (it's `perform_request`
    raises a `ConnectionError`) it will be marked as dead (via `mark_dead`) and
    put on a timeout (if it fails N times in a row the timeout is exponentially
    longer - the formula is `default_timeout * 2 ** (fail_count - 1)`). When
    the timeout is over the connection will be resurrected and returned to the
    live pool. A connection that has been previously marked as dead and
    succeeds will be marked as live (its fail count will be deleted).
