    Reindex all documents from one index that satisfy a given query
    to another, potentially (if `target_client` is specified) on a different cluster.
    If you don't specify the query you will reindex all the documents.

    Since ``2.3`` a :meth:`~elasticsearch.Elasticsearch.reindex` api is
    available as part of elasticsearch itself. It is recommended to use the api
    instead of this helper wherever possible. The helper is here mostly for
    backwards compatibility and for situations where more flexibility is
    needed.

    .. note::

        This helper doesn't transfer mappings, just the data.

    :arg query: body for the :meth:`~elasticsearch.Elasticsearch.search` api
    :arg target_client: optional, is specified will be used for writing (thus
        enabling reindex between clusters)

        maintained for scrolled search
