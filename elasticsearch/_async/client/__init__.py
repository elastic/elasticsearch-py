class AsyncElasticsearch(object):
    """
    Elasticsearch low-level client. Provides a straightforward mapping from
    Python to ES REST endpoints.

    The instance has attributes ``cat``, ``cluster``, ``indices``, ``ingest``,
    ``nodes``, ``snapshot`` and ``tasks`` that provide access to instances of
    :class:`~elasticsearch.client.CatClient`,
    :class:`~elasticsearch.client.ClusterClient`,
    :class:`~elasticsearch.client.IndicesClient`,
    :class:`~elasticsearch.client.IngestClient`,
    :class:`~elasticsearch.client.NodesClient`,
    :class:`~elasticsearch.client.SnapshotClient` and
    :class:`~elasticsearch.client.TasksClient` respectively. This is the
    preferred (and only supported) way to get access to those classes and their
    methods.

    You can specify your own connection class which should be used by providing
    the ``connection_class`` parameter::

        # create connection to localhost using the ThriftConnection
        es = Elasticsearch(connection_class=ThriftConnection)

    If you want to turn on :ref:`sniffing` you have several options (described
    in :class:`~elasticsearch.Transport`)::

        # create connection that will automatically inspect the cluster to get
        # the list of active nodes. Start with nodes running on 'esnode1' and
        # 'esnode2'
        es = Elasticsearch(
            ['esnode1', 'esnode2'],
            # sniff before doing anything
            sniff_on_start=True,
            # refresh nodes after a node fails to respond
            sniff_on_connection_fail=True,
            # and also every 60 seconds
            sniffer_timeout=60
        )

    Different hosts can have different parameters, use a dictionary per node to
    specify those::

        # connect to localhost directly and another node using SSL on port 443
        # and an url_prefix. Note that ``port`` needs to be an int.
        es = Elasticsearch([
            {'host': 'localhost'},
            {'host': 'othernode', 'port': 443, 'url_prefix': 'es', 'use_ssl': True},
        ])

    If using SSL, there are several parameters that control how we deal with
    certificates (see :class:`~elasticsearch.Urllib3HttpConnection` for
    detailed description of the options)::

        es = Elasticsearch(
            ['localhost:443', 'other_host:443'],
            # turn on SSL
            use_ssl=True,
            # make sure we verify SSL certificates
            verify_certs=True,
            # provide a path to CA certs on disk
            ca_certs='/path/to/CA_certs'
        )

    If using SSL, but don't verify the certs, a warning message is showed
    optionally (see :class:`~elasticsearch.Urllib3HttpConnection` for
    detailed description of the options)::

        es = Elasticsearch(
            ['localhost:443', 'other_host:443'],
            # turn on SSL
            use_ssl=True,
            # no verify SSL certificates
            verify_certs=False,
            # don't show warnings about ssl certs verification
            ssl_show_warn=False
        )

    SSL client authentication is supported
    (see :class:`~elasticsearch.Urllib3HttpConnection` for
    detailed description of the options)::

        es = Elasticsearch(
            ['localhost:443', 'other_host:443'],
            # turn on SSL
            use_ssl=True,
            # make sure we verify SSL certificates
            verify_certs=True,
            # provide a path to CA certs on disk
            ca_certs='/path/to/CA_certs',
            # PEM formatted SSL client certificate
            client_cert='/path/to/clientcert.pem',
            # PEM formatted SSL client key
            client_key='/path/to/clientkey.pem'
        )

    Alternatively you can use RFC-1738 formatted URLs, as long as they are not
    in conflict with other options::

        es = Elasticsearch(
            [
                'http://user:secret@localhost:9200/',
                'https://user:secret@other_host:443/production'
            ],
            verify_certs=True
        )

    By default, `JSONSerializer
    <https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py/blob/master/elasticsearch/serializer.py#L24>`_
    is used to encode all outgoing requests.
    However, you can implement your own custom serializer::

        from elasticsearch.serializer import JSONSerializer

        class SetEncoder(JSONSerializer):
            def default(self, obj):
                if isinstance(obj, set):
                    return list(obj)
                if isinstance(obj, Something):
                    return 'CustomSomethingRepresentation'
                return JSONSerializer.default(self, obj)

        es = Elasticsearch(serializer=SetEncoder())

    """

        :arg hosts: list of nodes, or a single node, we should connect to.

        :arg pre_filter_shard_size: A threshold that enforces a pre-
            filter roundtrip to prefilter search shards based on query rewriting if
            the number of shards the search request expands to exceeds the
            threshold. This filter roundtrip can limit the number of shards

            search request. These fields take
            precedence over mapped fields with the same name.
        :arg script_fields: Retrieve a script evaluation (based on
            different fields) for each hit.

            page through more
            than 10,000 hits using the from and size parameters. To page through
            more
            hits, use the search_after parameter.
        :arg slice:
        :arg sort:
        :arg stats: Stats groups to associate with the search. Each
            group maintains a statistics
            aggregation for its associated searches. You can retrieve these stats
            using
            the indices stats API.
        :arg stored_fields: List of stored fields to return as part of a
            hit. If no fields are specified,
            no stored fields are included in the response. If this field is
            specified, the _source
            parameter defaults to false. You can pass _source: true to return both
            source fields
            and stored fields in the search response.
        :arg suggest:
        :arg suggest_field: Specifies which field to use for
            suggestions.
        :arg suggest_mode: Specify suggest mode  Valid choices: missing,
            popular, always  Default: missing
        :arg suggest_size: How many suggestions to return in response
        :arg suggest_text: The source text for which the suggestions
            should be returned.
        :arg terminate_after: Maximum number of documents to collect for
            each shard. If a query reaches this
            limit, Elasticsearch terminates the query early. Elasticsearch collects
            documents
            before sorting. Defaults to 0, which does not terminate query execution
            early.
        :arg timeout: Specifies the period of time to wait for a
            response from each shard. If no response
            is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an
            error.
            Defaults to no timeout.
        :arg track_scores: If true, calculate and return document
            scores, even if the scores are not used for sorting.
        :arg track_total_hits: Number of hits matching the query to
            count accurately. If true, the exact
            number of hits is returned at the cost of some performance. If false,
            the
            response does not include the total number of hits matching the query.
            Defaults to 10,000 hits.
        :arg typed_keys: Specify whether aggregation and suggester names
            should be prefixed by their respective types in the response
        :arg version: If true, returns document version as part of a
            hit.

        :arg index: Comma-separated list of data streams, indices, or
            aliases to search
        :arg field: Field containing geospatial data to return
        :arg zoom: Zoom level for the vector tile to search
        :arg x: X coordinate for the vector tile to search
        :arg y: Y coordinate for the vector tile to search
        :arg body: Search request body.

            Supports the following aggregation types:

            If true, the meta layer’s feature is a bounding box resulting from a
            geo_bounds aggregation. The aggregation runs on <field> values that
            intersect
            the <zoom>/<x>/<y> tile with wrap_longitude set to false. The resulting
            bounding box may be larger than the vector tile.
        :arg extent: Size, in pixels, of a side of the tile. Vector
            tiles are square with equal sides.
        :arg fields: Fields to return in the `hits` layer. Supports
            wildcards (`*`).
            This parameter does not support fields with array values. Fields with
            array
            values may return inconsistent results.
        :arg grid_precision: Additional zoom levels available through
            the aggs layer. For example, if <zoom> is 7
            and grid_precision is 8, you can zoom in up to level 15. Accepts 0-8. If
            0, results
            don’t include the aggs layer.
        :arg grid_type: Determines the geometry type for features in the
            aggs layer. In the aggs layer,
            each feature represents a geotile_grid cell. If 'grid' each feature is a
            Polygon
            of the cells bounding box. If 'point' each feature is a Point that is
            the centroid
            of the cell.
        :arg query: Query DSL used to filter documents for the search.
        :arg runtime_mappings: Defines one or more runtime fields in the
            search request. These fields take
            precedence over mapped fields with the same name.
        :arg size: Maximum number of features to return in the hits
            layer. Accepts 0-10000.
            If 0, results don’t include the hits layer.
        :arg sort: Sorts features in the hits layer. By default, the API
            calculates a bounding
            box for each feature. It sorts features based on this box’s diagonal
            length,
            from longest to shortest.
