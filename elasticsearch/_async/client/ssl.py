        Get SSL certificates. Get information about the X.509 certificates that are used
        to encrypt communications in the cluster. The API returns a list that includes
        certificates from all TLS contexts including: - Settings for transport and HTTP
        interfaces - TLS settings that are used within authentication realms - TLS settings
        for remote monitoring exporters The list includes certificates that are used
        for configuring trust, such as those configured in the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore`
        and `xpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate_authorities` settings. It also
        includes certificates that are used for configuring server identity, such as
        `xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore` and `xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate settings`.
        The list does not include certificates that are sourced from the default SSL
        context of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), even if those certificates are
        in use within Elasticsearch. NOTE: When a PKCS#11 token is configured as the
        truststore of the JRE, the API returns all the certificates that are included
        in the PKCS#11 token irrespective of whether these are used in the Elasticsearch
        TLS configuration. If Elasticsearch is configured to use a keystore or truststore,
        the API output includes all certificates in that store, even though some of the
        certificates might not be in active use within the cluster.
