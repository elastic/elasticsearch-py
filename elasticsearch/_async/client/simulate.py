        Simulate data ingestion. Run ingest pipelines against a set of provided documents,
        optionally with substitute pipeline definitions, to simulate ingesting data into
        an index. This API is meant to be used for troubleshooting or pipeline development,
        as it does not actually index any data into Elasticsearch. The API runs the default
        and final pipeline for that index against a set of documents provided in the
        body of the request. If a pipeline contains a reroute processor, it follows that
        reroute processor to the new index, running that index's pipelines as well the
        same way that a non-simulated ingest would. No data is indexed into Elasticsearch.
        Instead, the transformed document is returned, along with the list of pipelines
        that have been run and the name of the index where the document would have been
        indexed if this were not a simulation. The transformed document is validated
        against the mappings that would apply to this index, and any validation error
        is reported in the result. This API differs from the simulate pipeline API in
        that you specify a single pipeline for that API, and it runs only that one pipeline.
        The simulate pipeline API is more useful for developing a single pipeline, while
        the simulate ingest API is more useful for troubleshooting the interaction of
        the various pipelines that get applied when ingesting into an index. By default,
        the pipeline definitions that are currently in the system are used. However,
        you can supply substitute pipeline definitions in the body of the request. These
        will be used in place of the pipeline definitions that are already in the system.
        This can be used to replace existing pipeline definitions or to create new ones.
        The pipeline substitutions are used only within this request.

        :param docs: Sample documents to test in the pipeline.
        :param index: The index to simulate ingesting into. This value can be overridden
            by specifying an index on each document. If you specify this parameter in
            the request path, it is used for any documents that do not explicitly specify
            an index argument.
        :param component_template_substitutions: A map of component template names to
            substitute component template definition objects.
        :param index_template_subtitutions: A map of index template names to substitute
            index template definition objects.
        :param mapping_addition:
        :param pipeline: The pipeline to use as the default pipeline. This value can
            be used to override the default pipeline of the index.
        :param pipeline_substitutions: Pipelines to test. If you donâ€™t specify the `pipeline`
            request path parameter, this parameter is required. If you specify both this
            and the request path parameter, the API only uses the request path parameter.
