        :param repository: The name of the repository for the snapshot.
        :param snapshot: The name of the snapshot. It supportes date math. It must be
            unique in the repository.
        :param expand_wildcards: Determines how wildcard patterns in the `indices` parameter
            match data streams and indices. It supports comma-separated values such as
            `open,hidden`.
        :param feature_states: The feature states to include in the snapshot. Each feature
            state includes one or more system indices containing related data. You can
            view a list of eligible features using the get features API. If `include_global_state`
            is `true`, all current feature states are included by default. If `include_global_state`
            is `false`, no feature states are included by default. Note that specifying
            an empty array will result in the default behavior. To exclude all feature
            states, regardless of the `include_global_state` value, specify an array
            with only the value `none` (`["none"]`).
        :param ignore_unavailable: If `true`, the request ignores data streams and indices
            in `indices` that are missing or closed. If `false`, the request returns
            an error for any data stream or index that is missing or closed.
        :param include_global_state: If `true`, the current cluster state is included
            in the snapshot. The cluster state includes persistent cluster settings,
            composable index templates, legacy index templates, ingest pipelines, and
            ILM policies. It also includes data stored in system indices, such as Watches
            and task records (configurable via `feature_states`).
        :param indices: A comma-separated list of data streams and indices to include
            in the snapshot. It supports a multi-target syntax. The default is an empty
            array (`[]`), which includes all regular data streams and regular indices.
            To exclude all data streams and indices, use `-*`. You can't use this parameter
            to include or exclude system indices or system data streams from a snapshot.
            Use `feature_states` instead.
        :param master_timeout: The period to wait for a connection to the master node.
            If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails
            and returns an error.
        :param metadata: Arbitrary metadata to the snapshot, such as a record of who
            took the snapshot, why it was taken, or any other useful data. It can have
            any contents but it must be less than 1024 bytes. This information is not
            automatically generated by Elasticsearch.
        :param partial: If `true`, it enables you to restore a partial snapshot of indices
            with unavailable shards. Only shards that were successfully included in the
            snapshot will be restored. All missing shards will be recreated as empty.
            If `false`, the entire restore operation will fail if one or more indices
            included in the snapshot do not have all primary shards available.
        :param wait_for_completion: If `true`, the request returns a response when the
            snapshot is complete. If `false`, the request returns a response when the
            snapshot initializes.

            (`*`) are supported. * To get information about all snapshots in a registered
            repository, use a wildcard (`*`) or `_all`. * To get information about any
            snapshots that are currently running, use `_current`.
        :param after: An offset identifier to start pagination from as returned by the
            next field in the response body.
        :param from_sort_value: The value of the current sort column at which to start
            retrieval. It can be a string `snapshot-` or a repository name when sorting
            by snapshot or repository name. It can be a millisecond time value or a number
            when sorting by `index-` or shard count.
        :param ignore_unavailable: If `false`, the request returns an error for any snapshots
            that are unavailable.
        :param include_repository: If `true`, the response includes the repository name
            in each snapshot.
        :param index_details: If `true`, the response includes additional information
            about each index in the snapshot comprising the number of shards in the index,
            the total size of the index in bytes, and the maximum number of segments
            per shard in the index. The default is `false`, meaning that this information
            is omitted.
        :param index_names: If `true`, the response includes the name of each index in
            each snapshot.

            If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails

        :param offset: Numeric offset to start pagination from based on the snapshots
            matching this request. Using a non-zero value for this parameter is mutually
            exclusive with using the after parameter. Defaults to 0.
        :param order: The sort order. Valid values are `asc` for ascending and `desc`
            for descending order. The default behavior is ascending order.
        :param size: The maximum number of snapshots to return. The default is 0, which
            means to return all that match the request without limit.
        :param slm_policy_filter: Filter snapshots by a comma-separated list of snapshot
            lifecycle management (SLM) policy names that snapshots belong to. You can
            use wildcards (`*`) and combinations of wildcards followed by exclude patterns
            starting with `-`. For example, the pattern `*,-policy-a-\\*` will return
            all snapshots except for those that were created by an SLM policy with a
            name starting with `policy-a-`. Note that the wildcard pattern `*` matches
            all snapshots created by an SLM policy but not those snapshots that were
            not created by an SLM policy. To include snapshots that were not created
            by an SLM policy, you can use the special pattern `_none` that will match
            all snapshots without an SLM policy.
        :param sort: The sort order for the result. The default behavior is sorting by
            snapshot start time stamp.
        :param verbose: If `true`, returns additional information about each snapshot
            such as the version of Elasticsearch which took the snapshot, the start and
            end times of the snapshot, and the number of shards snapshotted. NOTE: The

          <p>Analyze a snapshot repository.
          Analyze the performance characteristics and any incorrect behaviour found in a repository.</p>
          <p>The response exposes implementation details of the analysis which may change from version to version.
          The response body format is therefore not considered stable and may be different in newer versions.</p>
          <p>There are a large number of third-party storage systems available, not all of which are suitable for use as a snapshot repository by Elasticsearch.
          Some storage systems behave incorrectly, or perform poorly, especially when accessed concurrently by multiple clients as the nodes of an Elasticsearch cluster do. This API performs a collection of read and write operations on your repository which are designed to detect incorrect behaviour and to measure the performance characteristics of your storage system.</p>
          <p>The default values for the parameters are deliberately low to reduce the impact of running an analysis inadvertently and to provide a sensible starting point for your investigations.
          Run your first analysis with the default parameter values to check for simple problems.
          If successful, run a sequence of increasingly large analyses until you encounter a failure or you reach a <code>blob_count</code> of at least <code>2000</code>, a <code>max_blob_size</code> of at least <code>2gb</code>, a <code>max_total_data_size</code> of at least <code>1tb</code>, and a <code>register_operation_count</code> of at least <code>100</code>.
          Always specify a generous timeout, possibly <code>1h</code> or longer, to allow time for each analysis to run to completion.
          Perform the analyses using a multi-node cluster of a similar size to your production cluster so that it can detect any problems that only arise when the repository is accessed by many nodes at once.</p>
          <p>If the analysis fails, Elasticsearch detected that your repository behaved unexpectedly.
          This usually means you are using a third-party storage system with an incorrect or incompatible implementation of the API it claims to support.
          If so, this storage system is not suitable for use as a snapshot repository.
          You will need to work with the supplier of your storage system to address the incompatibilities that Elasticsearch detects.</p>
          <p>If the analysis is successful, the API returns details of the testing process, optionally including how long each operation took.
          You can use this information to determine the performance of your storage system.
          If any operation fails or returns an incorrect result, the API returns an error.
          If the API returns an error, it may not have removed all the data it wrote to the repository.
          The error will indicate the location of any leftover data and this path is also recorded in the Elasticsearch logs.
          You should verify that this location has been cleaned up correctly.
          If there is still leftover data at the specified location, you should manually remove it.</p>
          <p>If the connection from your client to Elasticsearch is closed while the client is waiting for the result of the analysis, the test is cancelled.
          Some clients are configured to close their connection if no response is received within a certain timeout.
          An analysis takes a long time to complete so you might need to relax any such client-side timeouts.
          On cancellation the analysis attempts to clean up the data it was writing, but it may not be able to remove it all.
          The path to the leftover data is recorded in the Elasticsearch logs.
          You should verify that this location has been cleaned up correctly.
          If there is still leftover data at the specified location, you should manually remove it.</p>
          <p>If the analysis is successful then it detected no incorrect behaviour, but this does not mean that correct behaviour is guaranteed.
          The analysis attempts to detect common bugs but it does not offer 100% coverage.
          Additionally, it does not test the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Your repository must perform durable writes. Once a blob has been written it must remain in place until it is deleted, even after a power loss or similar disaster.</li>
          <li>Your repository must not suffer from silent data corruption. Once a blob has been written, its contents must remain unchanged until it is deliberately modified or deleted.</li>
          <li>Your repository must behave correctly even if connectivity from the cluster is disrupted. Reads and writes may fail in this case, but they must not return incorrect results.</li>

          <p>IMPORTANT: An analysis writes a substantial amount of data to your repository and then reads it back again.
          This consumes bandwidth on the network between the cluster and the repository, and storage space and I/O bandwidth on the repository itself.
          You must ensure this load does not affect other users of these systems.
          Analyses respect the repository settings <code>max_snapshot_bytes_per_sec</code> and <code>max_restore_bytes_per_sec</code> if available and the cluster setting <code>indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec</code> which you can use to limit the bandwidth they consume.</p>
          <p>NOTE: This API is intended for exploratory use by humans. You should expect the request parameters and the response format to vary in future versions.</p>
          <p>NOTE: Different versions of Elasticsearch may perform different checks for repository compatibility, with newer versions typically being stricter than older ones.
          A storage system that passes repository analysis with one version of Elasticsearch may fail with a different version.
          This indicates it behaves incorrectly in ways that the former version did not detect.
          You must work with the supplier of your storage system to address the incompatibilities detected by the repository analysis API in any version of Elasticsearch.</p>
          <p>NOTE: This API may not work correctly in a mixed-version cluster.</p>
          <p><em>Implementation details</em></p>
          <p>NOTE: This section of documentation describes how the repository analysis API works in this version of Elasticsearch, but you should expect the implementation to vary between versions. The request parameters and response format depend on details of the implementation so may also be different in newer versions.</p>
          <p>The analysis comprises a number of blob-level tasks, as set by the <code>blob_count</code> parameter and a number of compare-and-exchange operations on linearizable registers, as set by the <code>register_operation_count</code> parameter.
          These tasks are distributed over the data and master-eligible nodes in the cluster for execution.</p>
          <p>For most blob-level tasks, the executing node first writes a blob to the repository and then instructs some of the other nodes in the cluster to attempt to read the data it just wrote.
          The size of the blob is chosen randomly, according to the <code>max_blob_size</code> and <code>max_total_data_size</code> parameters.
          If any of these reads fails then the repository does not implement the necessary read-after-write semantics that Elasticsearch requires.</p>
          <p>For some blob-level tasks, the executing node will instruct some of its peers to attempt to read the data before the writing process completes.
          These reads are permitted to fail, but must not return partial data.
          If any read returns partial data then the repository does not implement the necessary atomicity semantics that Elasticsearch requires.</p>
          <p>For some blob-level tasks, the executing node will overwrite the blob while its peers are reading it.
          In this case the data read may come from either the original or the overwritten blob, but the read operation must not return partial data or a mix of data from the two blobs.
          If any of these reads returns partial data or a mix of the two blobs then the repository does not implement the necessary atomicity semantics that Elasticsearch requires for overwrites.</p>
          <p>The executing node will use a variety of different methods to write the blob.
          For instance, where applicable, it will use both single-part and multi-part uploads.
          Similarly, the reading nodes will use a variety of different methods to read the data back again.
          For instance they may read the entire blob from start to end or may read only a subset of the data.</p>
          <p>For some blob-level tasks, the executing node will cancel the write before it is complete.
          In this case, it still instructs some of the other nodes in the cluster to attempt to read the blob but all of these reads must fail to find the blob.</p>
          <p>Linearizable registers are special blobs that Elasticsearch manipulates using an atomic compare-and-exchange operation.
          This operation ensures correct and strongly-consistent behavior even when the blob is accessed by multiple nodes at the same time.
          The detailed implementation of the compare-and-exchange operation on linearizable registers varies by repository type.
          Repository analysis verifies that that uncontended compare-and-exchange operations on a linearizable register blob always succeed.
          Repository analysis also verifies that contended operations either succeed or report the contention but do not return incorrect results.
          If an operation fails due to contention, Elasticsearch retries the operation until it succeeds.
          Most of the compare-and-exchange operations performed by repository analysis atomically increment a counter which is represented as an 8-byte blob.
          Some operations also verify the behavior on small blobs with sizes other than 8 bytes.</p>

          <p>This API enables you to perform a comprehensive check of the contents of a repository, looking for any anomalies in its data or metadata which might prevent you from restoring snapshots from the repository or which might cause future snapshot create or delete operations to fail.</p>
          <p>If you suspect the integrity of the contents of one of your snapshot repositories, cease all write activity to this repository immediately, set its <code>read_only</code> option to <code>true</code>, and use this API to verify its integrity.
          Until you do so:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>It may not be possible to restore some snapshots from this repository.</li>
          <li>Searchable snapshots may report errors when searched or may have unassigned shards.</li>
          <li>Taking snapshots into this repository may fail or may appear to succeed but have created a snapshot which cannot be restored.</li>
          <li>Deleting snapshots from this repository may fail or may appear to succeed but leave the underlying data on disk.</li>
          <li>Continuing to write to the repository while it is in an invalid state may causing additional damage to its contents.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If the API finds any problems with the integrity of the contents of your repository, Elasticsearch will not be able to repair the damage.
          The only way to bring the repository back into a fully working state after its contents have been damaged is by restoring its contents from a repository backup which was taken before the damage occurred.
          You must also identify what caused the damage and take action to prevent it from happening again.</p>
          <p>If you cannot restore a repository backup, register a new repository and use this for all future snapshot operations.
          In some cases it may be possible to recover some of the contents of a damaged repository, either by restoring as many of its snapshots as needed and taking new snapshots of the restored data, or by using the reindex API to copy data from any searchable snapshots mounted from the damaged repository.</p>
          <p>Avoid all operations which write to the repository while the verify repository integrity API is running.
          If something changes the repository contents while an integrity verification is running then Elasticsearch may incorrectly report having detected some anomalies in its contents due to the concurrent writes.
          It may also incorrectly fail to report some anomalies that the concurrent writes prevented it from detecting.</p>
          <p>NOTE: This API is intended for exploratory use by humans. You should expect the request parameters and the response format to vary in future versions.</p>
          <p>NOTE: This API may not work correctly in a mixed-version cluster.</p>
          <p>The default values for the parameters of this API are designed to limit the impact of the integrity verification on other activities in your cluster.
          For instance, by default it will only use at most half of the <code>snapshot_meta</code> threads to verify the integrity of each snapshot, allowing other snapshot operations to use the other half of this thread pool.
          If you modify these parameters to speed up the verification process, you risk disrupting other snapshot-related operations in your cluster.
          For large repositories, consider setting up a separate single-node Elasticsearch cluster just for running the integrity verification API.</p>
          <p>The response exposes implementation details of the analysis which may change from version to version.
          The response body format is therefore not considered stable and may be different in newer versions.</p>

        :param feature_states: The feature states to restore. If `include_global_state`
            is `true`, the request restores all feature states in the snapshot by default.
            If `include_global_state` is `false`, the request restores no feature states
            by default. Note that specifying an empty array will result in the default
            behavior. To restore no feature states, regardless of the `include_global_state`

        :param ignore_index_settings: The index settings to not restore from the snapshot.
            You can't use this option to ignore `index.number_of_shards`. For data streams,
            this option applies only to restored backing indices. New backing indices
            are configured using the data stream's matching index template.
        :param ignore_unavailable: If `true`, the request ignores any index or data stream

            an error for any missing index or data stream.
        :param include_aliases: If `true`, the request restores aliases for any restored
            data streams and indices. If `false`, the request doesn’t restore aliases.
        :param include_global_state: If `true`, restore the cluster state. The cluster
            state includes: * Persistent cluster settings * Index templates * Legacy
            index templates * Ingest pipelines * Index lifecycle management (ILM) policies
            * Stored scripts * For snapshots taken after 7.12.0, feature states If `include_global_state`
            is `true`, the restore operation merges the legacy index templates in your
            cluster with the templates contained in the snapshot, replacing any existing
            ones whose name matches one in the snapshot. It completely removes all persistent
            settings, non-legacy index templates, ingest pipelines, and ILM lifecycle
            policies that exist in your cluster and replaces them with the corresponding
            items from the snapshot. Use the `feature_states` parameter to configure
            how feature states are restored. If `include_global_state` is `true` and
            a snapshot was created without a global state then the restore request will
            fail.
        :param index_settings: Index settings to add or change in restored indices, including
            backing indices. You can't use this option to change `index.number_of_shards`.
            For data streams, this option applies only to restored backing indices. New
            backing indices are configured using the data stream's matching index template.
        :param indices: A comma-separated list of indices and data streams to restore.
            It supports a multi-target syntax. The default behavior is all regular indices
            and regular data streams in the snapshot. You can't use this parameter to
            restore system indices or system data streams. Use `feature_states` instead.
        :param master_timeout: The period to wait for the master node. If the master
            node is not available before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns
            an error. To indicate that the request should never timeout, set it to `-1`.
        :param partial: If `false`, the entire restore operation will fail if one or
            more indices included in the snapshot do not have all primary shards available.
            If true, it allows restoring a partial snapshot of indices with unavailable
            shards. Only shards that were successfully included in the snapshot will
            be restored. All missing shards will be recreated as empty.
        :param rename_pattern: A rename pattern to apply to restored data streams and
            indices. Data streams and indices matching the rename pattern will be renamed
            according to `rename_replacement`. The rename pattern is applied as defined
            by the regular expression that supports referencing the original text, according
            to the `appendReplacement` logic.
        :param rename_replacement: The rename replacement string that is used with the
            `rename_pattern`.
        :param wait_for_completion: If `true`, the request returns a response when the
            restore operation completes. The operation is complete when it finishes all
            attempts to recover primary shards for restored indices. This applies even
            if one or more of the recovery attempts fail. If `false`, the request returns
            a response when the restore operation initializes.
