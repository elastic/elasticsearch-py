        :param index: Name of the index.

        :param routing: Custom value used to route operations to a specific shard.
        :param timeout: Specifies the period of time to wait for a response from each
            shard. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request
            fails and returns an error. Defaults to no timeout.
