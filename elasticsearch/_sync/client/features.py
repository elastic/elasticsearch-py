          <p>Get the features.
          Get a list of features that can be included in snapshots using the <code>feature_states</code> field when creating a snapshot.
          You can use this API to determine which feature states to include when taking a snapshot.
          By default, all feature states are included in a snapshot if that snapshot includes the global state, or none if it does not.</p>
          <p>A feature state includes one or more system indices necessary for a given feature to function.
          In order to ensure data integrity, all system indices that comprise a feature state are snapshotted and restored together.</p>
          <p>The features listed by this API are a combination of built-in features and features defined by plugins.
          In order for a feature state to be listed in this API and recognized as a valid feature state by the create snapshot API, the plugin that defines that feature must be installed on the master node.</p>
