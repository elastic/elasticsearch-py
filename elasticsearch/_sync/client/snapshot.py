            in `indices` that are missing or closed. If `false`, the request returns

            unavailable shards. Only shards that were successfully included in the snapshot
            will be restored. All missing shards will be recreated as empty. If `false`,
            the entire restore operation will fail if one or more indices included in
            the snapshot do not have all primary shards available.
        :param wait_for_completion: If `true`, the request returns a response when the
            snapshot is complete. If `false`, the request returns a response when the
            snapshot initializes.

        Analyze a snapshot repository. Analyze the performance characteristics and any
        incorrect behaviour found in a repository. The response exposes implementation
        details of the analysis which may change from version to version. The response
        body format is therefore not considered stable and may be different in newer
        versions. There are a large number of third-party storage systems available,
        not all of which are suitable for use as a snapshot repository by Elasticsearch.
        Some storage systems behave incorrectly, or perform poorly, especially when accessed
        concurrently by multiple clients as the nodes of an Elasticsearch cluster do.
        This API performs a collection of read and write operations on your repository
        which are designed to detect incorrect behaviour and to measure the performance
        characteristics of your storage system. The default values for the parameters
        are deliberately low to reduce the impact of running an analysis inadvertently
        and to provide a sensible starting point for your investigations. Run your first
        analysis with the default parameter values to check for simple problems. If successful,
        run a sequence of increasingly large analyses until you encounter a failure or
        you reach a `blob_count` of at least `2000`, a `max_blob_size` of at least `2gb`,
        a `max_total_data_size` of at least `1tb`, and a `register_operation_count` of
        at least `100`. Always specify a generous timeout, possibly `1h` or longer, to
        allow time for each analysis to run to completion. Perform the analyses using
        a multi-node cluster of a similar size to your production cluster so that it
        can detect any problems that only arise when the repository is accessed by many
        nodes at once. If the analysis fails, Elasticsearch detected that your repository
        behaved unexpectedly. This usually means you are using a third-party storage
        system with an incorrect or incompatible implementation of the API it claims
        to support. If so, this storage system is not suitable for use as a snapshot
        repository. You will need to work with the supplier of your storage system to
        address the incompatibilities that Elasticsearch detects. If the analysis is
        successful, the API returns details of the testing process, optionally including
        how long each operation took. You can use this information to determine the performance
        of your storage system. If any operation fails or returns an incorrect result,
        the API returns an error. If the API returns an error, it may not have removed
        all the data it wrote to the repository. The error will indicate the location
        of any leftover data and this path is also recorded in the Elasticsearch logs.
        You should verify that this location has been cleaned up correctly. If there
        is still leftover data at the specified location, you should manually remove
        it. If the connection from your client to Elasticsearch is closed while the client
        is waiting for the result of the analysis, the test is cancelled. Some clients
        are configured to close their connection if no response is received within a
        certain timeout. An analysis takes a long time to complete so you might need
        to relax any such client-side timeouts. On cancellation the analysis attempts
        to clean up the data it was writing, but it may not be able to remove it all.
        The path to the leftover data is recorded in the Elasticsearch logs. You should
        verify that this location has been cleaned up correctly. If there is still leftover
        data at the specified location, you should manually remove it. If the analysis
        is successful then it detected no incorrect behaviour, but this does not mean
        that correct behaviour is guaranteed. The analysis attempts to detect common
        bugs but it does not offer 100% coverage. Additionally, it does not test the
        following: * Your repository must perform durable writes. Once a blob has been
        written it must remain in place until it is deleted, even after a power loss
        or similar disaster. * Your repository must not suffer from silent data corruption.
        Once a blob has been written, its contents must remain unchanged until it is
        deliberately modified or deleted. * Your repository must behave correctly even
        if connectivity from the cluster is disrupted. Reads and writes may fail in this
        case, but they must not return incorrect results. IMPORTANT: An analysis writes
        a substantial amount of data to your repository and then reads it back again.
        This consumes bandwidth on the network between the cluster and the repository,
        and storage space and I/O bandwidth on the repository itself. You must ensure
        this load does not affect other users of these systems. Analyses respect the
        repository settings `max_snapshot_bytes_per_sec` and `max_restore_bytes_per_sec`
        if available and the cluster setting `indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec` which
        you can use to limit the bandwidth they consume. NOTE: This API is intended for
        exploratory use by humans. You should expect the request parameters and the response
        format to vary in future versions. NOTE: Different versions of Elasticsearch
        may perform different checks for repository compatibility, with newer versions
        typically being stricter than older ones. A storage system that passes repository
        analysis with one version of Elasticsearch may fail with a different version.
        This indicates it behaves incorrectly in ways that the former version did not
        detect. You must work with the supplier of your storage system to address the
        incompatibilities detected by the repository analysis API in any version of Elasticsearch.
        NOTE: This API may not work correctly in a mixed-version cluster. *Implementation
        details* NOTE: This section of documentation describes how the repository analysis
        API works in this version of Elasticsearch, but you should expect the implementation
        to vary between versions. The request parameters and response format depend on
        details of the implementation so may also be different in newer versions. The
        analysis comprises a number of blob-level tasks, as set by the `blob_count` parameter
        and a number of compare-and-exchange operations on linearizable registers, as
        set by the `register_operation_count` parameter. These tasks are distributed
        over the data and master-eligible nodes in the cluster for execution. For most
        blob-level tasks, the executing node first writes a blob to the repository and
        then instructs some of the other nodes in the cluster to attempt to read the
        data it just wrote. The size of the blob is chosen randomly, according to the
        `max_blob_size` and `max_total_data_size` parameters. If any of these reads fails
        then the repository does not implement the necessary read-after-write semantics
        that Elasticsearch requires. For some blob-level tasks, the executing node will
        instruct some of its peers to attempt to read the data before the writing process
        completes. These reads are permitted to fail, but must not return partial data.
        If any read returns partial data then the repository does not implement the necessary
        atomicity semantics that Elasticsearch requires. For some blob-level tasks, the
        executing node will overwrite the blob while its peers are reading it. In this
        case the data read may come from either the original or the overwritten blob,
        but the read operation must not return partial data or a mix of data from the
        two blobs. If any of these reads returns partial data or a mix of the two blobs
        then the repository does not implement the necessary atomicity semantics that
        Elasticsearch requires for overwrites. The executing node will use a variety
        of different methods to write the blob. For instance, where applicable, it will
        use both single-part and multi-part uploads. Similarly, the reading nodes will
        use a variety of different methods to read the data back again. For instance
        they may read the entire blob from start to end or may read only a subset of
        the data. For some blob-level tasks, the executing node will cancel the write
        before it is complete. In this case, it still instructs some of the other nodes
        in the cluster to attempt to read the blob but all of these reads must fail to
        find the blob. Linearizable registers are special blobs that Elasticsearch manipulates
        using an atomic compare-and-exchange operation. This operation ensures correct
        and strongly-consistent behavior even when the blob is accessed by multiple nodes
        at the same time. The detailed implementation of the compare-and-exchange operation
        on linearizable registers varies by repository type. Repository analysis verifies
        that that uncontended compare-and-exchange operations on a linearizable register
        blob always succeed. Repository analysis also verifies that contended operations
        either succeed or report the contention but do not return incorrect results.
        If an operation fails due to contention, Elasticsearch retries the operation
        until it succeeds. Most of the compare-and-exchange operations performed by repository
        analysis atomically increment a counter which is represented as an 8-byte blob.
        Some operations also verify the behavior on small blobs with sizes other than
        8 bytes.

        Verify the repository integrity. Verify the integrity of the contents of a snapshot
        repository. This API enables you to perform a comprehensive check of the contents
        of a repository, looking for any anomalies in its data or metadata which might
        prevent you from restoring snapshots from the repository or which might cause
        future snapshot create or delete operations to fail. If you suspect the integrity
        of the contents of one of your snapshot repositories, cease all write activity
        to this repository immediately, set its `read_only` option to `true`, and use
        this API to verify its integrity. Until you do so: * It may not be possible to
        restore some snapshots from this repository. * Searchable snapshots may report
        errors when searched or may have unassigned shards. * Taking snapshots into this
        repository may fail or may appear to succeed but have created a snapshot which
        cannot be restored. * Deleting snapshots from this repository may fail or may
        appear to succeed but leave the underlying data on disk. * Continuing to write
        to the repository while it is in an invalid state may causing additional damage
        to its contents. If the API finds any problems with the integrity of the contents
        of your repository, Elasticsearch will not be able to repair the damage. The
        only way to bring the repository back into a fully working state after its contents
        have been damaged is by restoring its contents from a repository backup which
        was taken before the damage occurred. You must also identify what caused the
        damage and take action to prevent it from happening again. If you cannot restore
        a repository backup, register a new repository and use this for all future snapshot
        operations. In some cases it may be possible to recover some of the contents
        of a damaged repository, either by restoring as many of its snapshots as needed
        and taking new snapshots of the restored data, or by using the reindex API to
        copy data from any searchable snapshots mounted from the damaged repository.
        Avoid all operations which write to the repository while the verify repository
        integrity API is running. If something changes the repository contents while
        an integrity verification is running then Elasticsearch may incorrectly report
        having detected some anomalies in its contents due to the concurrent writes.
        It may also incorrectly fail to report some anomalies that the concurrent writes
        prevented it from detecting. NOTE: This API is intended for exploratory use by
        humans. You should expect the request parameters and the response format to vary
        in future versions. NOTE: This API may not work correctly in a mixed-version
        cluster.

        Restore a snapshot. Restore a snapshot of a cluster or data streams and indices.
        You can restore a snapshot only to a running cluster with an elected master node.
        The snapshot repository must be registered and available to the cluster. The
        snapshot and cluster versions must be compatible. To restore a snapshot, the
        cluster's global metadata must be writable. Ensure there are't any cluster blocks
        that prevent writes. The restore operation ignores index blocks. Before you restore
        a data stream, ensure the cluster contains a matching index template with data
        streams enabled. To check, use the index management feature in Kibana or the
        get index template API: ``` GET _index_template/*?filter_path=index_templates.name,index_templates.index_template.index_patterns,index_templates.index_template.data_stream
        ``` If no such template exists, you can create one or restore a cluster state
        that contains one. Without a matching index template, a data stream can't roll
        over or create backing indices. If your snapshot contains data from App Search
        or Workplace Search, you must restore the Enterprise Search encryption key before
        you restore the snapshot.
